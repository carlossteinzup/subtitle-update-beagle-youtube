00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hi guys, my name is LuÃ­s Eduardo and I

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,779
am a developer here at Zup, a

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,000
company that is agitating the

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,880
tech market with Open Source

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,730
projects. In this video we are going to

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,369
talk about Beagle and I will teach you

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,020
how to install Beagle Scaffold in your

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,020
Android project.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,829
Let's access the main page

10
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,949
usebeagle.io and click on

11
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:33,510
documentation, here it's Docs. Here in docs

12
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:37,390
we are going to access 'Get Started' > 'Using Beagle helpers' 

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,750
and select the Android platform and open

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:43,899
Beagle Scaffold page. On this page

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,610
there are the steps to install 

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,879
Beagle Scaffold in your Android

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,489
project. If you don't know,  Beagle Scaffold

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,879
is a library that contains 

19
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:57,609
all the initial configuration 

20
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,100
you need to provide for Beagle. So 

21
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,739
let's follow step by step. Our

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,710
first step is to create an Android project 

23
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:08,500
so, here let's open Android Studio, go

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:12,220
to 'Create New Project' and select

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,460
'Empty Activity' and name our

26
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,220
project 'My Beagle'. Select the 

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,470
Kotlin language. It's interesting to mention

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:25,550
Beagle accepts the API 19 or higher

29
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:28,730
So we will have to use in our

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:31,250
Android project the SDK 19 or

31
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,550
higher. So let's select here the

32
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:37,310
API 30 which is the most recent and let's click 

33
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,580
on 'Finish'. After this, Android Studio will

34
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:43,070
open our project. After opening the Android

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,490
project, let's go back to the documentation

36
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:49,040
and see what is the next step. So

37
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,620
the next step is to add the MavenCentral

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,720
there in our project, let's

39
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,910
go back to Android Studio and here 

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,729
let's open Gradle Scripts

41
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:01,970
and open the file build.gradle.project

42
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:05,750
And here in this file

43
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:08,990
let's search for allprojects code block 

44
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:12,320
and let's paste the MavenCentral

45
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,410
inside the repositories block that it is

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,870
inside allprojects, let's

47
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,840
paste and go back to the documentation to 

48
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,480
see what is the next step. The next

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,720
step is to add

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,480
the Beagle Scaffold lib dependencies and

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,930
Beagle's one and add some configuration 

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,959
in the build.gradle module file, so

53
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,299
let's copy here the plugins and go 

54
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,790
back to Android Studio and let's open here 

55
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:42,150
the build.gradle module file

56
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,870
So, let's open here and I will paste 

57
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:48,120
the plugins here. Let's go back to the documentation

58
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,549
copy the packagingOptions and we have to paste

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,650
it inside the Android block, so

60
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:57,239
the Android block is here and I will paste 

61
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,060
below kotlinOptions here. And 

62
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,400
out last step is to copy the

63
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,299
Beagle's dependencies and Beagle Scaffold's 

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,910
So I will copy and paste here. And

65
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,609
how can I see which is the lastest

66
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,220
Beagle and Beagle Scaffold

67
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:17,099
versions? I will go back here

68
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,440
to the documentation and above de code we have 

69
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,460
the most recent version, Beagle Scaffold

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,810
is in the 1.0.1 version

71
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:28,300
And Beagle is on 1.5.1 version. Let's

72
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,120
go back to Android Studio and verify

73
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,200
if we are using the lastest 

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:40,210
version. Beagle is in 1.5.1 version and

75
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:43,570
Beagle Scaffold 1.0.1 version, so let's

76
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:46,240
change and synchronize the project here

77
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,790
in this graddle button and I will click here

78
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,910
and it will download all the dependencies 

79
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:54,970
for us. After downloading the dependencies

80
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,940
we will go to usage configuration. So

81
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:01,270
let's go back to the documentation. Our

82
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,910
next step is to create a file

83
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,760
AppBeagleConfig, so let's go back to 

84
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,990
our project, I will open here the Java

85
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,930
package, the package of our project and here I 

86
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:16,390
will create a class. So I will create a

87
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,060
class and name it AppBeagleConfig

88
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,470
in this class we will have to use

89
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,090
Beagle's annotation, so about the class 

90
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:28,940
I will use the @BeagleComponent annotation.

91
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:32,030
Here in the class, we will inherit from

92
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,760
BeagleConfigScaffold. Our next step is

93
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,160
build the project because when you build

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,180
the project it will create a Beagle initialization

95
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,610
file called BeagleSetUp

96
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,830
So, lets go back to our project 

97
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:50,480
let's select here the tab build

98
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,090
and select the 'Make Project' option

99
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,600
Because of this process, the project will create 

100
00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:00,230
a Beagle file called BeagleSetup

101
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,750
It is the class that starts Beagle in our

102
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,540
project. After synchronize the project lets

103
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,450
go back to the documentantion and see what is

104
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,350
the next step. Our next step is

105
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,080
to create a file called AppApplication

106
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:18,230
where Beagle will be booted and

107
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,480
BeagleScaffold. Here the package in our project 

108
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:24,180
let's create a class called

109
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,690
AppApplication. Here in the class Application

110
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:31,350
it will inherit the Application

111
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:34,860
in the class we will call a method 

112
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:38,430
onCreate and inside the onCreate method

113
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,920
we will initialize Beagle

114
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,800
So lets call this class

115
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,680
BeagleScaffold where we will pass the class

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,450
BeagleSetup in the parameter. In the class

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,080
BeagleScaffold lets call

118
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,140
the init method passing the application, which is

119
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,230
'this'. So we have created our class

120
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:01,560
AppApplication and now we have to call it

121
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:05,160
in our file Manifest. So let's

122
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,040
open here the Manifest package and open the

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,260
androidmanifest.xml file. Here

124
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:14,160
in our Manifest file, we need to

125
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,400
change two things: lets add the

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,950
internet permission and lets name

127
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,460
it Application. Lets

128
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,639
first add here 

129
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,610
in the line 5 the permission for the internet, I

130
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,400
opened the tag and the uses-permission, internet

131
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,590
Here inside the Application tag we have to

132
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,810
name our class

133
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,419
application. So I will call the attribute

134
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,630
name passing the name of our class

135
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:43,289
Application, which it is  AppApplication. After this

136
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:46,569
process we finish this Beagle 

137
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:49,419
configuration part and now 

138
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,940
we will call a screen to render

139
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,400
our Android project. Lets go back to

140
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,039
the documentation and see the step to 

141
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,460
call the screen from the BFF. Then

142
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,220
lets copy here the startActivity, in the

143
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,650
mainActivity class, lets paste the 

144
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,320
startActivity we have already copied from 

145
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,840
the documentation. What does this line do? It

146
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,449
calls the screen from the 

147
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,960
backend that it will render a 

148
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:20,050
screen coming from the BFF where there are all

149
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,470
Beagle's components. So after this

150
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:26,240
process lets click on 

151
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:28,910
'Run app' and it will render our

152
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,520
first screen in this emulator. So let's

153
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,730
open here the emulator and wait

154
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,830
to render. That's it guys we rendered

155
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,350
our first screen in an

156
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,600
Android project. If you have any doubts
