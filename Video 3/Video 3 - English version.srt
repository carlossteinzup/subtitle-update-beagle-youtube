00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02.070
What's up guys, my name is LuÃ­s Eduardo

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04,230
and I'm a developer here at Zup It

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,330
A company that is revolutionizing the

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08,429
technology market with its open-source

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,250
projects. In this video we are going to talk about

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,340
Beagle, and show you how

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,650
you can contribute with Beagle's documentation.

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.470
you can contribute with Beagle's documentation

9
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.020
[Song]

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,150
First, I opened the

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,970
Beagle documentation at the link "docs.usebeagle.io"

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,310
And this is how it looks like,

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31.730
in the left menu, we have an option to

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,280
"contribute". Here, we have a page

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,800
from Beagle Docs that will give you a

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39.710
information on how to use the documentation tool we adopt,

17
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.739
the requirements you need to run it, etc. And

18
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,710
how can you document in Beagle Docs. So...

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47.960
To document Beagle we use a tool called

20
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.800
HUGO that allows us to create static

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,710
page websites, using Markdown files.

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,320
To contribute, it is necessary to

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59.930
fulfill some requirements that are listed here, at this page.

24
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02,000
This page demonstrates how you can

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04.849
contribute to the documentation and also how

26
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.540
to use Hugo shortcodes section. The Shortcodes

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,270
are new visual elements and interfaces

28
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,180
that can be used to build a better organized

29
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,000
documentation. Unfortunately, Markdown syntax won't

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19.580
offer all resources necessary to best

31
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21,030
organize elements in a documentation section, so

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24.390
through these Shortcodes, you will have access

33
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.760
tp more features and elements to use when building

34
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.420
a documentation page, in this example, you can refer

35
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.740
links, show Alerts like hints, show

36
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.090
images, embed videos, among other things!

37
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.860
So I'm going back here for the "overview"

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,290
from Docs and now let's talk

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45.450
a little bit about how you can contribute...

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,270
There are two ways you can

41
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.850
contribute to the Documentation. The first is here

42
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.820
in the upper right corner, where we list a

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,390
small menu with some options. So through this menu

44
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.450
you can edit the page you are on, or

45
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03,030
create another page. You can also

46
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06.030
create an "issue" to suggest an

47
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09,119
improvement on this page, or even correct any error that

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,340
you may have found in the documentation. You may

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14.069
create an "issue" for our team to analyze

50
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,130
and maybe even add your suggestion. So this is

51
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,560
the first way for you to contribute

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,010
with our Docs! But there is

53
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,220
another to contribute

54
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.750
which is through the

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28.780
Beagle repository on GitHub.

56
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.360
You can open the "beagle-docs", which is where

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,000
the Beagle documentation repository is located, and here you can

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,700
fork the repository by cloning it

59
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,260
and them open it locally in any

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,360
text editor of your choice. Those

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,360
are the two ways to contribute, but there are

62
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50.019
some points that require our attention. When looking at the top menu

63
00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.659
there is an option to change the Beagle Version you wish the documentation for

64
00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.980
When we published this video, we had versions 1.5, 1.6, 1.7

65
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59.680
So, how does it work? If you are

66
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.769
using Beagle version 1.5 in your project

67
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:05,319
you will open the documentation in 1.5

68
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,480
to see the Beagle features at version 1.5. If

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,299
you are using Beagle version 1.6

70
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,150
you will open the documentation in 1.6 and

71
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,760
so on, so forth. In this first

72
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,000
menu option, called "Edit this page", you will be able to change

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21.020
the contents for

74
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,500
the latest Beagle version, which in this example was the

75
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,770
1.7... So, how do I contribute

76
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,180
on version 1.5 or 1.6? Which are older versions

77
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34.640
You will be able to do it by

78
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.520
forking our repository. So, you must clone our

79
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.610
repository on your machine and open it

80
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.400
in any text editor, in the example here

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,610
I will use

82
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,340
the Visual Studio. Before we start, lets

83
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.410
make this example clear...

84
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.590
Let's assume I'm going to contribute to the

85
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,080
documentation version 1.5. To

86
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,130
make a change to the 1.5 version I need to access the

87
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04.460
branch release-v1.5 (locally) and

88
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.430
create another branch from it

89
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.440
That i'm able to modify and create a pull request to merge it

90
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.020
 into the branch release-v1.5. This goes for all versions

91
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,360
in our documentation. So if I want to contribute to the

92
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,839
version 1.6, I must access the release

93
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,029
branch-v1.6 and create a new

94
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,670
branch from it and again open a pull request

95
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,360
for the release branch 1.6 right? It is important to make

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,550
this details very clear so you could

97
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,980
contribute in the correct

98
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35.010
way. I'm opening my editor here...

99
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.070
the Visual Studio and them I will

100
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.530
open the documentation. I already have

101
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.780
cloned the repository here, So I have

102
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45.450
it locally on my machine. I will

103
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,560
open a new project here, Open a folder and

104
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,530
select the documentation folder

105
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,530
Open it and them the Visual Studio will

106
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,620
list the project for me. Here, notice the

107
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.260
"content" folder in my project structure

108
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,470
this is the folder that contains all the

109
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.950
documentation content separated by language; which is Portuguese,

110
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,130
in the PT folder... So if I want to edit a

111
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,729
content in Portuguese, I'll edit

112
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,790
in this folder. So I'm going to open the PT folder and I

113
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21.009
will edit the "overview" file that

114
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24.729
is the one we were seeing.

115
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,569
If I want to edit a page

116
00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.469
in English, I'm going to open the EN folder

117
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.800
and open the MD file I want to

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,270
edit or even create a new one, ok? So this is

119
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,309
the way you can contribute

120
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45.399
with our Documentation and that's it guys! Thank you very much
